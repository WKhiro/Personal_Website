The only exceptions to this would be if you are absolutely dominating, or building glass-cannon Riven. In these cases, you might consider Youmuu's Ghostblade as your second item, but in any other case, you will be building Death's Dance. That is just how essential this item is on Riven. Besides granting some helpful armor and magic resistance, the passive of this item allows Riven to heal from inflicting ANY kind of damage, whether it be in the form of autoattacks or abilities. Since Riven can quickly chain together autoattacks and abilities, she can heavily abuse this passive. In addition, by having Death's Dance convert 30% of all damage you take into bleed damage, you effectively become tankier, since you don't immediately take as much damage as you would without this item. In the past, Riven's Valor (E) shield was on such a low cooldown that you could essentially tank all the bleed damage with your shield, making her an unkillable monster. However, with the nerfs to her shield cooldown, she isn't able to do this anymore. Thus, having some extra health (e.g. from Black Cleaver) is extremely useful so you don't just bleed to death. This is also the reason why I do not suggest building Death's Dance first; you will not have enough CDR or health to negate bleed damage effectively."),i.a.createElement("h5",null," Funnily enough, you are effectively done with your core build at this point.
