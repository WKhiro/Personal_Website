# Personal Website

Just like the repository title states, this is a personal website. I've used ReactJS for a group project before, but wanted to use what I learned (and had yet to learn) about ReactJS to make my own website. <br/>
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Features

My personal website currently features:

### `Home`

A home page that gives visitors an overview about me.

### `Blog`

A blog page that will contain random posts about coding, games, and etc.

### `Projects`

A page that contains links to projects I've worked on previously.
